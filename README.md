# web-design-challenge

For this challenge, we used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), jQuery, HTML and CSS to create a custom responsive website. The CSS  included some [Flexbox CSS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and media queries to reposition the navigation and layouts for optimal viewing on large (992px), medium (768px), and small (576px) size screens. The CSS also included plenty of class inheritance and CSS selectors to add elements of interactivity to the design.
